# My WebDev Portfolio

## Functionality
This is a daily event that allows you to save an event and changes color of the time block depending on what time of day it is. 
The program uses local storage to save user input. 

## Improvements
Improvements I could make is just actually being able to save data and also change color based on the current time. 

## Challenges I faced
I struggled IMMENSLY on the javascript portion of this project. I feel like I know exactly what javascript things do what, and I know how to use everything I've learned, but I just don't know how to connect them. How to make them all connect into this big project. So I know how to seperatly make functions but when it comes to making them link to each other i'm lost.

## What did I learn
I had a lot of practice on javascript. Didn't learn alot though.
